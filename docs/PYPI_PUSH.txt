PyPI Publishing Instructions for grid-stix
==========================================

Prerequisites
-------------
1. PyPI account: https://pypi.org/account/register/
2. TestPyPI account (optional): https://test.pypi.org/account/register/
3. API tokens configured (recommended over username/password)
4. Install build tools: pip install build twine

Build Package
-------------
1. make pipbuild 

Test Upload (Optional but Recommended)
--------------------------------------
Upload to TestPyPI first to verify everything works:

1. Upload to TestPyPI:
   twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

2. Test installation from TestPyPI:
   pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ grid-stix

Production Upload
-----------------
1. Configure ~/.pypirc:
   [pypi]
   username = __token__
   password = pypi-YOUR-TOKEN-HERE

2. Upload to PyPI:
   twine upload dist/*

3. Verify the upload:
   pip install grid-stix
   python -c "import grid_stix; print(grid_stix.__version__)"

Version Bumping
---------------
Before each release, update the version in pyproject.toml:
   version = "X.Y.Z"

Follow semantic versioning:
- MAJOR (X): Breaking API changes
- MINOR (Y): New features, backward compatible
- PATCH (Z): Bug fixes, backward compatible

Troubleshooting
---------------
- "File already exists": You cannot overwrite existing versions on PyPI.
  Bump the version number and rebuild.

- "Invalid credentials": Ensure you're using __token__ as username
  and your API token (starting with pypi-) as password.

- Package not found after upload: Wait a few minutes for PyPI to index.
